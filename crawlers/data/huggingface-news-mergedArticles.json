    "content": "思维链(CoT)因其有效性和引人注目的核心理念（鼓励模型通过显式中间推理步骤解决复杂问题）长期成为AI领域最热门的技术之一。但研究人员通常会修改原始CoT方法，寻找能进一步改进LLM推理的技巧。\n\n以下是10种最新的增强CoT方法：\n1. 防御性思维链\n2. 混合思维链\n3. 语义级和标记级思维链\n4. 推测性思维链(SCoT)\n5. 协作思维链(Co-CoT)\n6. XS-CoT跨语言框架\n（更多细节见原文）",
    "rawContent": "10 new Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT) methods\n\nCoT has long been one of the hottest techniques in AI thanks to its effectiveness and compelling core idea: encouraging models to solve complex problems through explicit intermediate reasoning steps. But usually researchers modify original CoT approach, finding tips that further improve LLMs' reasoning. That's what we're going to talk about today.\n\nHere's a list of 10 latest enhanced CoT approaches:\n\n1. Chain-of-Defensive-Thought -> https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.20769\nProvides a few structured, defensive reasoning exemplars to improve the robustness of LLMs\n\n2. Hybrid-CoT -> https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.21659\nProposes using Adaptive Hybrid Reasoning Model (AdaR1) that combines Long- and Short-CoT, and applying bi-level preference training to select effective reasoning styles\n\n3. Semantic-level and token-level CoT -> https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.00703\nIntroduces T2I-R1 text-to-image gen model, that uses semantic-level CoT for prompt planning and token-level CoT for pixel-level generation, while BiCoT-GRPO coordinates them both\n\n4. Speculative CoT (SCoT) -> https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.19095\nSCoT drafts multiple reasoning paths with a lightweight draft, selects the best, and uses the target model for correction - all this to reduce latency by 48–66%\n\n5. Collaborative CoT (Co-CoT) -> https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.17091\nBreaks reasoning into blocks that users can inspect, modify and re-run, promoting active engagement. An adaptation mechanism aligns outputs with diverse cognitive styles and user goals\n\n6. XS-CoT -> https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.20835\nIt's a cross-lingual framework that integrates speech-to-text translation into reasoning, using a semi-implicit CoT approach to compress intermediate tokens. This improves non-core language responses by up to 45%\n\nRead further in the comments 👇\n\nIf you liked this, also subscribe to the Turing Post -> https://www.turingpost.com/subscribe",

    "rawContent": "📢💾 Introducing the Common Crawl Creative Commons Corpus (C5)!\n\nC5 is a large-scale effort to heavily filter web-crawled data, as collected by the non-profit Common Crawl, to only documents that are Creative Commons-licensed such as cc-by-4.0 or public domain cc0. At this stage 150 billion tokens have been collected.\n\n---\n📄 data: https://huggingface.co/datasets/BramVanroy/CommonCrawl-CreativeCommons\n🧰 software: https://github.com/BramVanroy/CommonCrawl-CreativeCommons\n---\n\n</> To build C5, HTML pages are scrutinized and all links (if any) to CC licenses are collected, both in regular hyperlinks as well as in metadata. Additional data fields are included such as \"was the license found in the `head`?\" or \"if multiple licenses were found, do they contradict each other?\", which makes further filtering a breeze. \n\n🌐 In this first version of C5, 8 languages are included (Afrikaans, German, English, French, Frysian, Italian, Dutch and Spanish). The language set was limited for two reasons: computational and storage limitations, and a collaboration with GPT-NL, which requested CC data for these languages to train a Dutch-focused, copyright-conscious LLM. In total, this V1 release contains almost 150 thousand documents and 150 billion tokens. This data was not filtered on quality nor deduplicated so that you can decide for yourself how much data to keep. To give some quality indication, a dataset field is present to describe whether a document is included in the FineWeb(-2) datasets, which are of high quality.\n\n🔍 More work needs to be done! Only 7 out of 100+ Common Crawl crawls have been processed so far. That's encouraging because it means there is a lot more Creative Commons data to be collected! But to get there I need help in terms of compute. The current processing was already heavily sponsored by the Flemish Supercomputer but more is needed. If you have the compute available and which to collaborate in an open and transparent manner, please get in touch! ",
