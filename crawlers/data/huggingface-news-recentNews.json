But usually researchers modify original CoT approach, finding tips that further improve LLMs' reasoning. That's what we're going to talk about today.\n\nHere's a list of 10 latest enhanced CoT approaches:\n\n1. Chain-of-Defensive-Thought -> https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.20769\nProvides a few structured, defensive reasoning exemplars to improve the robustness of LLMs\n\n2. Hybrid-CoT -> https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.21659\nProposes using Adaptive Hybrid Reasoning Model (AdaR1) that combines Long- and Short-CoT, and applying bi-level preference training to select effective reasoning styles\n\n3. Semantic-level and token-level CoT -> https://huggingface.co/papers/2505.00703\nIntroduces T2I-R1 text-to-image gen model, that uses semantic-level CoT for prompt planning and token-level CoT for pixel-level generation, while BiCoT-GRPO coordinates them both\n\n4. Speculative CoT (SCoT) -> https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.19095\nSCoT drafts multiple reasoning paths with a lightweight draft, selects the best, and uses the target model for correction - all this to reduce latency by 48–66%\n\n5. Collaborative CoT (Co-CoT) -> https://huggingface.co/papers/2504.17091\nBreaks reasoning into blocks that users can inspect, modify and re-run, promoting active engagement.

At this stage 150 billion tokens have been collected.\n\n---\n📄 data: https://huggingface.co/datasets/BramVanroy/CommonCrawl-CreativeCommons\n🧰 software: https://github.com/BramVanroy/CommonCrawl-CreativeCommons\n---\n\n</> To build C5, HTML pages are scrutinized and all links (if any) to CC licenses are collected, both in regular hyperlinks as well as in metadata. Additional data fields are included such as \"was the license found in the `head`?\" or \"if multiple licenses were found, do they contradict each other?\", which makes further filtering a breeze. \n\n🌐 In this first version of C5, 8 languages are included (Afrikaans, German, English, French, Frysian, Italian, Dutch and Spanish). The language set was limited for two reasons: computational and storage limitations, and a collaboration with GPT-NL, which requested CC data for these languages to train a Dutch-focused, copyright-conscious LLM. In total, this V1 release contains almost 150 thousand documents and 150 billion tokens. This data was not filtered on quality nor deduplicated so that you can decide for yourself how much data to keep. To give some quality indication, a dataset field is present to describe whether a document is included in the FineWeb(-2) datasets, which are of high quality.\n\n🔍 More work needs to be done! Only 7 out of 100+ Common Crawl crawls have been processed so far. That's encouraging because it means there is a lot more Creative Commons data to be collected! But to get there I need help in terms of compute. The current processing was already heavily sponsored by the Flemish Supercomputer but more is needed. If you have the compute available and which to collaborate in an open and transparent manner, please get in touch! ",
    "rawContent": "📢💾 Introducing the Common Crawl Creative Commons Corpus (C5)!\n\nC5 is a large-scale effort to heavily filter web-crawled data, as collected by the non-profit Common Crawl, to only documents that are Creative Commons-licensed such as cc-by-4.0 or public domain cc0. At this stage 150 billion tokens have been collected.\n\n---\n📄 data: https://huggingface.co/datasets/BramVanroy/CommonCrawl-CreativeCommons\n🧰 software: https://github.com/BramVanroy/CommonCrawl-CreativeCommons\n---\n\n</> To build C5, HTML pages are scrutinized and all links (if any) to CC licenses are collected, both in regular hyperlinks as well as in metadata. Additional data fields are included such as \"was the license found in the `head`?\" or \"if multiple licenses were found, do they contradict each other?\", which makes further filtering a breeze. \n\n🌐 In this first version of C5, 8 languages are included (Afrikaans, German, English, French, Frysian, Italian, Dutch and Spanish). The language set was limited for two reasons: computational and storage limitations, and a collaboration with GPT-NL, which requested CC data for these languages to train a Dutch-focused, copyright-conscious LLM. In total, this V1 release contains almost 150 thousand documents and 150 billion tokens. This data was not filtered on quality nor deduplicated so that you can decide for yourself how much data to keep. To give some quality indication, a dataset field is present to describe whether a document is included in the FineWeb(-2) datasets, which are of high quality.\n\n🔍 More work needs to be done! Only 7 out of 100+ Common Crawl crawls have been processed so far. That's encouraging because it means there is a lot more Creative Commons data to be collected! But to get there I need help in terms of compute. The current processing was already heavily sponsored by the Flemish Supercomputer but more is needed. If you have the compute available and which to collaborate in an open and transparent manner, please get in touch! ",
